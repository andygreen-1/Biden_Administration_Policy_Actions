# Biden Administration Policy Tracking Project

The Biden Administration Policy Tracking Project aims to record, summarize, and visualize policy actions taken by the Biden administration. This includes actions like releasing a new policy proposal, issuing executive orders, and working with Congress to pass legislation.
